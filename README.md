# ds-algo
It is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms that I am compiling while practicing and learning new algorithms so there will be lots of repetitive and redundant (sometimes incorrect) code. Feel free to contribute by adding more algorithms, making the existing once better and correcting the incorrect once. Always open for negative feedback :)
